Hi Christine,

Thanks for your patience with me following up with you. There was a glitch in the system and Justin's scorecard from your interview never came through or I would have followed up sooner.

I am glad to hear that you completed the project and I hope it's up and running smoothly! We are definitely still interested in moving forward.

Below you will find detailed instructions for the Take Home.

Bitcoin is a very difficult protocol to work with, especially for a newcomer to cryptocurrencies, so this challenge is to create an interface for a new, much simpler online currency, the Jobcoin. Jobcoins have “addresses” that are just arbitrary strings, and there’s no mining or transaction signing - anyone can create jobcoins out of thin air, or send them to an address.

You can access the Jobcoin management interface and APIs at

https://jobcoin.gemini.com/shank-enviably

There you will create a new Jobcoin address with an amount. Play around with the API interface. Create lots of Jobcoins and send to people (Or random strings ;) !

Once created, your challenge will be to make a 2 page website that allows users to send Jobcoins and check the balance. Ensure that your endpoints include a send to https urls.

Requirements

Create 2 screens
Sign in page (using any created address from the management tool)
Send page, sending to any address (any string of text)
Track the balance of a Jobcoin address
Ability to send Jobcoin to an address and track those transactions and the resulting balance
Display transaction history visually (chart, line graph etc)
High res UX screens

Screen 1

UI Elements
Sign in widget
Assumptions
No user/pass needed. You ‘sign in’ by typing in an address created in the management tool and submitting.
Screen 2

UI Elements
Balance of the entered jobcoin address
Send widget
Data vis (graph)
Sign out (back to the home/previous screen)
Assumptions
User can send to any address (any string of text)
This will be tracked via the graph and balance
Again, we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems. This is not meant to win any design awards. Please use any framework, libraries, or tools that you think are appropriate to solve the problem. And don’t hesitate to ask any questions. Expect this to take 3-5 hours to complete.

The graph is meant to show the account balance over time however you’d like. Make sure it updates when a new transaction is made.

Lastly, the wires are a guideline. Feel free to change the layout and add some style as you see fit. Just make sure all the elements are present in the final product.
